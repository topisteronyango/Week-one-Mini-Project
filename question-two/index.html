            My house is a cozy two-story building located in a quiet neighborhood. It has a 
            beautiful <a href="./graden.html">garden</a> that I take great pride in maintaining. The garden is filled with 
            colorful flowers and plants, making it a perfect place to relax and unwind after a 
            long day. The garden is spacious and has several seating areas where you can enjoy 
            the sunshine or read a book.

            Inside the house, there is a spacious <a href="./drawing.html">drawing room</a> that is perfect for entertaining 
            guests. The room is well-furnished with comfortable sofas and chairs, and it is 
            decorated with beautiful artwork and rugs. There are also <a href="./bedrooms.html">two bedrooms</a> in the house, 
            each with its own unique style and ambiance. The bedrooms are cozy and comfortable, 
            with large windows that let in plenty of natural light. Overall, my house is a warm 
            and inviting space that I am proud to call home.
